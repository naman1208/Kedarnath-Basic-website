Uttarakhand is both the new and traditional name of the state 
that was formed from the hill districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Literally
 North Country or Section in Sanskrit, the name of Uttarakhand finds 
mention in the early Hindu scriptures as the combined region of Kedarkhand 
and Manaskhand.<br>
Uttarakhand was also the ancient Puranic term for the central stretch of the
 Indian Himalayas. Its peaks and valleys were well known in ancient times
 as the abode of gods and goddesses and source of the Ganges River. Today, 
it is often called "the Land of the Gods" (Dev Bhoomi) because of the presence of 
a multitude of Hindu pilgrimage spots.<img src="h4.bmp" align=right> 
The Pauravas, Kushanas, Kunindas, Guptas, Katyuris, Palas, the Chands, and 
Parmars or Panwars and the British have ruled Uttarakhand in turns.<p>
<h2>Early history</h2>

<img src="h2.bmp" align=left>The region was originally settled by 
Kols, an aboriginal people of the Dravidian physical type who were later joined by 
Indo-Aryan Khas tribes that arrived from the northwest by the Vedic period. 
At that time, present-day Uttarakhand also served as a haunt for Rishis and 
Sadhus. It is believed that Sage Vyasa scripted the Mahabharata here as the Pandavas
 are believed to have traveled and camped in the region. Among the first major dynasties 
of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century B.C. who practiced 
an early form of Shaivism. They traded salt with Western Tibet. It is evident from 
the Ashokan edict at Kalsi, near Dehradun in Western Garhwal that Buddhism 
made inroads in this region. Folk shamanic practices deviating from Hindu orthodoxy 
also persisted here. However, Garhwal and Kumaon were restored to nominal Brahmanical
 rule due to the travails of Shankaracharya and the arrival of migrants from the plains.
 In the fourth century, the Kunindas gave way to the Naga Dynasties. Between the 7th 
and 14th centuries, the Katyuri dynasty of Khas origin dominated lands of varying
 extent from the Katyur (modern day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon. Other peoples of the
 Tibeto-Burman group known as Kiratas are thought to have settled in the northern 
highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region, and believed to be the ancestors
 to the modern day Bhotiya, Raji, Buksha, and Tharu peoples.<p>

Uttarakhand as a part of the United Province, 1903
By the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Garhwal Kingdom 
in the west and the Kumaon Kingdom in the east. From the 13th-18th century, 
Kumaon prospered under the Chand Rajas who had their origins in the plains of India. 
During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art) developed. 
The present king of Kumaon is Mahendra Chand of Lamakhet (Pithoragarh), he is married
 to Gita Chand of Rina and has three childrens (Aakanksha Chand, Mallika Chand,
 Aryan Chand) Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmar/
Panwar Rajas, who along with a mass migration of Brahmins and Rajputs, also 
arrived from the plains. In 1791, the expanding Gurkha Empire of Nepal, overran 
Almora, the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. In 1803, the Garhwal Kingdom also fell 
to the Gurkhas. With the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816, a rump 
portion of the Garhwal Kingdom was reestablished from Tehri, and eastern British
Garhwal and Kumaon ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli.
<h2>Post-independence</h2><img src="rr.bmp"  align ="left">

In the post-independence period, the Tehri princely state was merged into Uttar 
Pradesh
 state, where Uttarakhand composed the Garhwal and Kumaon Divisions. Until 1998, 
Uttarakhand was the name most commonly used to refer to the region, as various political
 groups including most significantly the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (Uttarakhand 
Revolutionary Party est. 1979), began agitating for separate statehood under 
its banner. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were 
traditional rivals with diverse lingual and cultural influences due to the proximity
 of different neighbouring ethnic groups, the inseparable 
and complementary nature of their geography, economy, culture, language, and 
traditions created strong bonds between the two regions.6:10 PM 9/29/2013 These 
bonds formed the basis of the new political identity of Uttarakhand, which gained 
significant momentum in 1994, when demand for separate statehood (within the 
Union of India) achieved almost unanimous acceptance among the local populace as
 well as political parties at the national level.<br><img src="h1.bmp" align="right">
<br>Most notable incident during this period was the Rampur Tiraha firing case on the 

night of October 1, 1994, which led to public uproar and eventually to the division
 of the 
state of Uttar Pradesh in 2000.
However, the term Uttaranchal came into use when the Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP) led central and Uttar Pradesh state governments initiated a new round of 
state reorganization in 1998 and introduced its preferred name. Chosen for its
 allegedly less separatist connotations, the name change generated enormous 
controversy among the rank and file of the separate state activists who saw it as
 a political act, however they were not quite as successful as Jharkhand state that
 successfully thwarted a similar move to impose the name Vananchal. Nevertheless, 
the name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region, even while Uttaranchal was 
promulgated through official usage.<hr>
